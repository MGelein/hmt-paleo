# Paleo Corrector
During the first sessions of the HMT project I found the counting of readings and creating of a sequence of id's a mind numbing task. This small web application provides you with one location where you can quickly create a corrected (counted and with ID in sequence) version of the file you have
created

## Use The Site
You can view the live version of this website [here](www.interwing.nl/hmt/paleo/)

The instructions can be found on the website, but in short:
- Copy the .cex contents from your file in your repo
- Paste the copied contents into the textfield on the website
- Press the 'Check and Correct' button to do just that with the pasted data. The data is automatically copied to your clipboard.
- Paste the copied contents back into your .cex file in your repository

### Credits
All credit for the data goes to the Homer Multitext project, their data curators and researchers.

All of the scripting, design and testing has been done by myself, Mees Gelein. Any part of this code can be freely reused by others both commercially or non-commercially.
